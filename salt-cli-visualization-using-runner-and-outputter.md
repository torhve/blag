# Visualizations in CLI using a custom salt outputter

As every sysadmin knows, shit happens. And when it does, you better identify the problem fast. And then you want to monitor the situation until it is resolved. The most common way is perhaps to just gather a ton of metrics, and graph it, and then find the relevant graphs. But sometimes you don't have the right metrics gathered, or you don't have time to find them all, but what you *do* have is Salt Minion running on all your machines, and it can gather just the data you want, be it numbers of pending mails in mailqueue or number of MySQL connections, etc.

One problem with numbers is that they can be hard to read in a hurried situation, so I figured I'd make a little tool to make CLI graphs out of number gathered using Salt remote execution to gather insights from numbers *quickly*. A couple of hours of clackity clackity clack later, the block outputter was born!

## Screenshots

Lets check how many CPUs these minions have:

Lets check the uptime:

How many connections are opened:

What is the Load ? 
*Oops*, looks like we have discovered a problem!

Now that we have discovered the proble, monitor it until problem is resolved by using the *watch* command.

## Further work

Many metrics are always increasing, not just a current number. Examples of this would be network traffic, nginx requests, CPU usage. The blocks runner could use a --interval parameter and then use the *derivative* value instead of the absolute to make a very simple network traffic monitor for example.

Right now salt runners does not have a nice way to use the targetting functions from salt regular, so I have not reimplemented anything but the standard globbing. I think salt runners itself should have that capability upstream, so runner writers does not have to reinvent their own targetting.

When the runner can be used in the interval style, it would be easy to instead of blocks use CLI sparklines instead and get a horizontal view. An example would be pinging hosts with network issues and getting sparklines with colors when they time out, etc.

The block outputter right now is fairly dumb. It should have the capability to parse any datastructure, right now it only supports 1 number per host, or a dict like the one that munin.run returns.
